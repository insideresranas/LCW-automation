The purpose of this assignment is simply to meet the requirements of the basic Selenium task. As you can see in the video, different category and product selections lead to different scenarios. Providing static values would solve the issue, but I preferred to use a dynamic structure.  I wanted to use randomness for this reason. Therefore, I did not add test cases to cover every scenario. For now, all requirements are met. You can check the video for reference.
